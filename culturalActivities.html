                <p>According to legend, long ago, when Sam Mountain was still desolate, 
                    villagers went up the mountain to discover an ancient statue sitting on a sandstone pedestal. 
                    At that time, Siamese troops often harassed our country. One time, they went to the top of Sam Mountain and met this ancient statue. 
                    Although he tried many times to carry the statue down the mountain, no matter how hard he tried, he could not move it.</p>
                    
                <p>The villagers saw this and wanted to "invite" the statue down the mountain to preserve and worship it. 
                    Many strong men were mobilized, but they could not lift the statue. When the village elders prayed, they were told, 
                    "Choose 9 virgin girls to take her down the mountain." Strangely enough, 9 girls carried her statue gently.
                    At the foot of the mountain, the statue suddenly became heavy and could not be lifted up. 
                    The villagers understood that she wanted to live here, so they built a shrine.</p>

                <p>To conduct bull racing, people draw lots to choose pairs in the order of pairs in front and pairs in back. 
                    The harrow's teeth are cut short, which is where the driver stands holding the rope to restrain the reins and holds a hard whip with a sharp tip to push beef butt. 
                    The operator usually stands with one foot on the harrow rig, and the other foot stands on the wooden bar connecting the cow's neck yoke to the harrow rig. 
                    A good person is someone who knows how to stand to distribute force to the cow while standing firmly to control the cow skillfully.</p>

                    <p>Bull racing is divided into 2 rounds, the first round is called Ho, the pairs of cows run slowly mainly to warm up the cows and gain momentum. 
                    In this round, the pair of cows running behind steps on the harrows of the previous pair of cows and is considered a loser. 
                    The next round is called the Drop round and is a sprint round in the last 100m. If the rear pair of cows step on the harrows of the previous pair of cows or pass them, they win. 
                    Technical errors such as breaking the harrow, violating the track or the bull driver falling out of the harrow in the Drop round are all considered losses. 
                    The winning pair of bulls will compete in the next round, competing in pairs until there is a final winning pair in the final round.</p>
