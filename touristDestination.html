                    <p>On the way to Ta Pa Pagoda you will pass Ta Pa Lake. Both sides of the lake are surrounded by high rocks,
                        the water is clear to the bottom, creating a enchanting beauty. Ta Pa Lake is an artificial lake formed during the stone mining process.
                        The water in the lake is rainwater and flows from underground rocks. However, the beauty of Ta Pa Lake is not inferior to any natural freshwater lake.
                        The clear blue water, sparkling lake bottom reflecting limestone, and the majestic surrounding natural scenery create an extremely poetic and charming setting.</p>
